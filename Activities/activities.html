		<h2>Sota Summer</h2>
		<p style="font-size: 18px;">I have spent every summer of my life in Minnesota, so I know how great it can be! Here are some activities I have done so far this summer.</p>

		<h3>Lake Days</h3>
		<p>As the Land of 10,000 Lakes, there are miles and miles of shoreline to enjoy during a Minnesota summer. The lakes in the twin cities area have many well-maintained public beaches to enjoy. If I'm having a lake day, my favorite place to go is Baker Park Reserve on Lake Independence. It has three seperate beaches and is usually less busy than other nearby park reserves.</p>

		<h3>The Arboretum</h3>
		<p>The Minnesota Landscape Arboretum is operated by the University of Minnesota. It has different kinds of plants, flowers and trees across 1,200 acres. It is my girlfriend and I's favorite place for a summer picnic! Whether it's for the tulip blooms in early summer, or fruit harvest in late summer, there is always a reason to go!</p>

		<h3>Boundary Waters</h3>
		<p>The boundary waters between Minnesota and Canada are famous for their natural beauty and excellent fishing. I have personally experienced both of those, as my family goes to Crane Lake every year in the middle of July.</p>

		<p>Crane Lake connects to Sand Point Lake, which is split in half by the Canadian Border. The northern shoreline of the lake is a part of Voyageurs National Park. Crane and Sand Point are the only lakes I have been on in the boundary waters, but this region of Minnesota is absolutely beautiful and a perfect getaway in the summer.</p>
