		This summer, I've been looking to expand some of my cooking skills. I have seeked out recipes for some of my favorite foods to try and make them myself. Cooking is a very rewarding activity that I have really enjoyed! Here is a few things I've been making recently.
		</p>
	<h2>Steak Sandwiches</h2>
	<p>I have always loved a Philly Cheesesteak. I attempted to make my own using <a href="https://www.fromvalerieskitchen.com/philly-cheesesteak-recipe-peppers-onions/#wprm-recipe-container-65610">This recipe.</a>

	<p>
	Some things that went well with this recipe were that the steak, onions and peppers came out really flavorful and tender. I did them in the same cast iron skillet and they were delicious. </p>
	<p>
	Some things I would do differently with this recipe is to use some kind of cheese sauce to pour over it instead of using slices of cheese. I also forgot the bread in the oven and it got a little burnt. </p>

	<h2>Lobster Tails</h2>
	<p> I got two lobster tails from work for $10. I had never made these before and followed <a href="https://www.wholesomeyum.com/the-best-broiled-lobster-tail-recipe/">This recipe's</a> method to cooking them. </p>

	<p>
	These looked and tasted amazing. I used the butter sauce from the recipe and it complimented the sweetness of the lobster tails perfectly. I had it with a side of rice.</p>
	<p>
	When I originally took them out of the oven, they were a little undercooked and gummy. I put them back in for another 2 minutes and they were much better.</p>

	<h2>Chicken Cutlets</h2>
	<p> I got on a bit of a sandwich kick. This was my attempt to create a chicken cutlet sandwich similar to one I had at Casetta. I followed <a href="https://simmerandsage.com/chicken-cutlet-sandwich-recipe-italian-style/"> this recipe </a> but substituted the kale for baby arugula, and provolone for fresh mozzarella. </p>

	<p>
	This is the meal I am most proud of. The chicken was nice and crispy, the bread had a nice crunch, the greens and tomato were perfect compliments to the sandwich. We had twice-baked potatoes on the side because my girlfriend loves them. The only thing I would've done differently is to season the bread crumbs that I breaded the chicken with.</p>
