		<h2>Intro</h2>
		<p style="font-size: 18px;">I have been bowling since I was five years old. It is my favorite hobby and I've spent the summer getting to tournaments whenever I can. Here you can see how I'm doing and what I'm throwing!</p>

				<h2>My Equipment</h2>
				<p>I have 8 different bowling balls. Most of the time, I bring 6 to a tournament or league. It is hard to explain why I have this many (I will try in the <a href="#explain">Explainer</a> section), but bowling balls are somewhat like golf clubs. Certain equipment fits certain conditions better. Plus, it's fun to get new things!</p>

				<p>I have clearly enjoyed the collegiate discount I recieve as a part of UW-Madison's team. 5 of the 6 balls in my bag were bought in the last year. My favorite recently is the Hammer Effect Tour.</p>

				<p>No matter where I'm bowling at, I have to try this ball first. If it works, I know I will have a good day.</p>

				<h2>My Year</h2>
					<p> This past year was my first on the UW-Madison bowling team. That experience really reinvigorated my love of bowling and got me back into the sport.</p>

					<p>Now that it's summer, I am looking for every opportunity to get out and continue bowling whenever I can. I troll facebook message boards looking for cheap tournaments to go to.</p>

					<p>I'm anxious to start my 2nd year on the collegiate team, hopefully the experience in my first year propels me to some stellar scores this year!</p>

			<h3 id="explain">Explainer</h3>
				<p style="font-size: 18px;">Bowling balls have a multitude of factors that effect how the ball performs, here is a quick guide to bowling ball reaction.</p>
				<dl>
					<dt style="font-family: Georgia, serif;">Cover Types</dt>
					<dd>There are 3 main types of covers for a bowling ball: Plastic, Urethane, and Reactive Resin.
						<ul> 
							<li>Plastic balls are designed to go straight. Most bowlers use them to hit spares.</li>
							<li>Urethane is an older technology that has resurfaced in the past decade or so. It hooks less than Reactive, but is more controllable and predictable.</li>
							<li>Most bowling balls produced today are reactive bowling balls. They provide the most hook potential.</li>
						</ul></dd>
					<dt style="font-family: Georgia, serif;">Core Numbers</dt>
					<dd>Inside each bowling ball is a core. These cores have different numbers given to them depending on what it does as it rolls. These numbers help bowlers determine what the ball will do for them.
						<ul>
							<li>Radius of Gyration (RG): RG determines how soon the ball begins to rev and change direction. It ranges from 2.45-2.80. The lower the RG, the sooner the ball revs and the earlier it changes direction </li>
							<li>Differential (Diff): Diff determines the bowling ball's "flare potential." As a bowling ball rotates around it's core, fresh bowling ball surface touches the lane, creating a "flare" of oil on the bowling ball. Diff-ranging from 0.001-0.060 determines how wide that track is, therefore telling you how much fresh cover touches the lane when you throw it. The higher the diff, the more the ball will generally hook.</li>
						</ul> </dd>	
				</dl>
				<figure style="background-color: #FA9B61; padding: 10px;">
					<p style="font-size: 18px;"> For a tangible example, lets use the Hammer Effect Tour.</p>
					<img src="Effect Tour.png" alt="Hammer Effect tour bowling ball and core" style="width: 300px;">
					<p style="font-size: 18px;">This ball has a reactive coverstock. Its RG in 15lbs is 2.47. This is a very low RG, which tells me that the ball will hook earlier on the lane. The Diff on the Effect Tour (15lbs) is 0.036. This is a relatively low differential for a reactive ball. This tells me that the ball has a tighter roll and will not make a big, dramatic hooking motion. Those two values together tell me that this is an early, smooth ball that will be helpful on tough conditions when I want something to be more predictable. I will not be able to hook across the entire lane with this ball because it will struggle to recover. This is how I use these two numbers to build an arsenal of equipment to attack any condition!</p> </figure>
