		<h1>Welcome!</h1>
		
		<p style= "background-color: #FFFFFF; font-size :18px;"> I have been making the most of this summer. I am spending it at home in Minnesota working at the same HyVee grocery store I have since high school. When I'm not working, I have been having fun around the state and growing myself. This website documents what I've been up to this summer and will maybe give you some suggestions of new things to try! </p>
